## 3. Code Standards & Architecture

### Naming Conventions
- **Files**: kebab-case (e.g., `enemy-behaviors.js`)
- **Classes**: PascalCase (e.g., `EnemyBehaviors`)
- **Functions/Variables**: camelCase (e.g., `spawnEnemy`)
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MAX_ENEMIES`)
- **Config Objects**: Nested objects with descriptive keys

### Code Quality
- Clean, optimized, maintainable
- Modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Performance-first approach (mobile optimization critical)
- Comprehensive comments for complex logic
- Use ES6+ features appropriately

### File Organization
```
/css/          - Stylesheets (base, controls, mobile, overlays, ui)
/js/
  /config/     - Game configuration and enemy types
  /core/       - Core game state and logic
  /systems/    - Game systems (rendering, pooling, behaviors, performance)
  /ui/         - UI components
  /utils/      - Utility functions (math, device detection)
```

### Performance Requirements
- Target: 60 FPS on mid-range mobile devices
- Use object pooling for frequently created/destroyed objects
- Batch rendering where possible
- Optimize physics calculations
- Minimize garbage collection
- Lazy load assets when appropriate

## 4. Safety & Security
- **No code that risks corruption, exploits, or instability**
- Always validate user input and system data
- Sanitize any external data sources
- Secure local storage usage
- No unauthorized data collection

### Optimization Checklist
1. **Lightweight assets**: Compress images, optimize audio files
2. **Scalable systems**: Design for various device capabilities
3. **Avoid unnecessary complexity**: KISS principle
4. **Memory management**: Proper cleanup and pooling
5. **Battery efficiency**: Minimize unnecessary calculations

## 5. AI & Automation Directives

### Mandatory First Reference
This file MUST be the first point of reference for any AI scanning the repository.

### Every AI Response Must
1. **Respect the GDD**: All suggestions must align with game design document
2. **Follow global parameters**: Adhere to rules stated in this document
3. **Maintain coherence**: Ensure consistency with existing code and design
4. **Include optimization**: Consider performance implications
5. **Ensure safety**: No risky or unstable code
6. **Integrate legal compliance**: Respect IP and licensing

### AI Behavior Guidelines
- **Read this file first** before making any suggestions or changes
- **Reference the GDD** when making design decisions
- **Check GameConfig.js** for tunable parameters before hardcoding values
- **Review existing code patterns** before introducing new patterns
- **Consider mobile constraints** in all implementations
- **Prioritize audio-visual feedback**: Sound design is critical to the experience
- **Test on mobile devices**: Desktop testing is insufficient
- **Respect the philosophical tone**: Maintain meditative, cosmic themes

### Conflict Resolution
**If a demand conflicts with this file â†’ The request is invalid and must be revised.**

When conflicts arise:
1. Refer to the GDD as the ultimate authority
2. Consult this ROOT_DIRECTIVE for technical standards
3. Check GameConfig.js for current parameter values
4. Review existing implementation patterns
5. If still unclear, ask for clarification before proceeding

## 6. Legal & Ownership

### Intellectual Property
**All assets, code, and content belong to Uppercut Studio.**

### Licensing
- No third-party assets or code may be used without explicit license compliance
- All dependencies must use compatible open-source licenses
- Commercial use restrictions must be respected

### Attribution
Contributors must follow agreed acknowledgment formats as specified by Uppercut Studio.

### Restrictions
- Unauthorized copying, redistribution, or misrepresentation is prohibited
- No derivative works without explicit permission
- Source code is proprietary unless explicitly open-sourced

### Third-Party Assets
Current project uses:
- Standard web technologies (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript ES6+)
- No external game engines
- Custom physics and rendering systems
- All audio must be original or properly licensed

## 7. Current Development Priorities

### Active Backlog Items
Based on `Roadmap_Eonwisp_Backlog`:

1. **Audio Autoplay**: Music must start immediately on page load (consider hover trigger for browser restrictions)
2. **Clean Logo Transitions**: Hide all UI elements (score, etc.) during logo fade-in/fade-out sequences
3. **Settings Menu Toggle**: Side menu with settings hidden by default, toggle with "U" key
4. **Mobile Controls**: 
   - Core, rope, and dart must be visible on mobile
   - Accelerometer controls must function properly
   - Fallback to virtual joystick if needed

### Known Issues to Address
- Music autoplay browser restrictions
- UI element visibility during intro sequences
- Mobile rendering and control responsiveness
- Accelerometer permission handling on iOS/Android

### Feature Priorities
1. **Core Gameplay Loop**: Ensure tetherball mechanics feel responsive and satisfying
2. **Audio-Visual Synesthesia**: Perfect the whip sound generation based on movement
3. **Mobile Optimization**: Smooth 60 FPS on target devices
4. **Power-Up System**: Balanced and meaningful upgrades
5. **Enemy Variety**: Diverse, telegraphed threats
6. **Rogue-Lite Progression**: Meaningful meta-progression between runs

## 8. Configuration Management

### Central Configuration
**All tunable parameters MUST be defined in `js/config/GameConfig.js`**

Never hardcode values that might need adjustment. Categories include:
- Physics parameters (stiffness, damping, impulse, gravity, etc.)
- Visual parameters (thickness, stretch, rotation, trails)
- Combat parameters (health, speed thresholds, damage)
- Effects parameters (slow-mo, camera, particles)
- Mobile controls (accelerometer sensitivity, deadzone, inversion)
- Core mechanics (radius, timers, intervals)
- Audio (scale frequencies, volume levels)
- Power-ups (spawn rates, durations, effects)
- Difficulty scaling (intensity, speed multipliers)

### Enemy Configuration
**All enemy types MUST be defined in `js/config/EnemyTypes.js`**

Enemy definitions include:
- Visual properties (color, size, shape)
- Movement patterns and speeds
- Attack behaviors and damage
- Health and defense mechanisms
- Audio cues and visual effects
- Spawn conditions and weights
