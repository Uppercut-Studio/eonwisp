1) autoplay music as soon as the page loads! maybe a hover trigger?  right now the music is not starting with the logos as intended.

2) when the logos fade in and out, I can see the pontuaçào and other unwanted UI elements.  please keep them hidden, make sure the logos and intros are super clean. 

3) only show the side menu with all the seettings if I press "U"on the keyboard. that should toggle it, so is hidden by default for most players. 

4)  mobile controls are not working.  the core, ropa and dart are not visible. please allow mobile users to use the accelerometer to get movement.
